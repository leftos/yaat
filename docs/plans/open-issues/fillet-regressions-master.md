# Fillet arc & ground navigation — master plan

Tracks fillet arc geometry bugs and ground navigation quality. Originally focused on fillet regressions; now expanded to cover smooth exit behavior and navigator speed management.

## Sub-plans (historical)

- `fillet-arc-taxi-misbehavior-wja1508.md` (Plan A — SFO 28R exit overshoot)
- `sfo-b10-taxi-stall.md` (Plan B — SFO mid-taxi stall)
- `fillet-arcs-sfo-at6-t6b.md` (Plan C — SFO T6/T6B arc symmetry)
- `oak-g-d-missing-fillet-arc.md` (Plan D — OAK G/D missing fillet arc)

## Status summary

| Sub-plan | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Plan A — WJA1508 exit overshoot | **Likely fixed** | Exit arc selection bugs fixed; needs retest |
| Plan B — SKW3078/DAL2581 taxi stall | **Fixed** (`45d5c06`) | Duplicate edge dedup fix resolved the stall |
| Plan C — SFO T6/T6B arc symmetry | **Fixed** (`e4621d7`) | Half-length cap + preserve intersection fixes |
| Plan D — OAK G/D missing fillet arc | **Fixed** (`45d5c06`, improved by `e4621d7`) | Dedup + half-cap fixes |

## Open issues — fillet geometry

### ~~1-3, 5, 10, 11~~ — all FIXED (see commit history)

### ~~4. MergeCoincidentNodes translates control points instead of recomputing~~ — **FIXED** (validator bug)

The ~980 OAK / ~1909 SFO warnings were caused by validator bugs, not merge translation:
1. Validator expected parallel alignment but fillet arc endpoints are anti-parallel with adjacent edges
2. Validator compared against all same-taxiway edges instead of the specific construction edge
3. Stored `EdgeBearingAtNode0Deg` used outbound bearing instead of actual `bearingToIntersection`

Fix: rewrote `CheckArcTangentAlignment` to compare against stored construction bearing, accepting parallel/anti-parallel. Fixed stored bearings. Result: 0 warnings at OAK and SFO.

### 6. `RebuildAdjacencyLists` called per-node is O(N×E) (LOW — performance)

Not a correctness issue. Fix: targeted adjacency update touching only changed edges.

### 9. DAL2581 test hang (MEDIUM)

Likely graph connectivity issue. Needs investigation with per-tick progress logging.

### ~~12. Disconnected taxiway subgraph: K/F nodes~~ — **FIXED**

Tangent nodes 1457/1458 at OAK K/F intersection (#439) were orphaned because:
1. Collinear pair K(→438)/K(→440) forced `preserveNode=true`
2. Walk through shape-point node 440 set `LandsInManualArc=true`
3. Preserve stub used `redirectToChain`, bypassing tangent nodes and connecting directly to far node 440
4. Tangent nodes had only the arc between them, no graph connectivity

Fix: always connect preserve stubs to the nearest tangent node instead of redirecting past it. The redirect was designed for actual arc chains but triggered on shape-point walks, disconnecting tangent nodes.

### ~~13. Exit pathfinder selects wrong-side fillet arc~~ — **FIXED** (`f6b0170`)

Three bugs in `FindAdjacentHoldShort`:
1. `visited.Add` before arc departure filter — rejected arc's endpoint marked visited, blocking valid non-arc paths to same node
2. BFS path used original centerlineNode for all seeds, but cluster expansion means seeds come from different cluster nodes
3. Inferred exit side not applied when taxiway was specified

---

## Open issues — ground navigation quality

### ~~14. Exit smoothness metric measures heading monotonicity instead of path deviation~~ — **FIXED** (OAK)

Redesigned `AssertSmoothExit` to measure cross-track deviation from the edge's infinite line. Added `PathDeviationFt` to `NavTickDiag`, polyline arc navigation (bezier subdivided into ~15ft waypoints), tight arrival threshold for arcs and short edges. Thresholds tightened to 35ft (50ft for >120° turns). All 24 OAK tests pass.

**SFO**: Not yet migrated (has pre-existing relaxation ordering failures to fix first).

### ~~15. GroundNavigator speed scaling too gentle for large heading errors~~ — **FIXED**

Changed from linear `clamp(1 - angleDiff/120, 0.15, 1.0)` to quadratic `max(0.03, 1 - (angleDiff/90)²)`. Gives: 0°=100%, 45°=75%, 60°=56%, 90°=3%. Modest path deviation improvement on most exits (2-4ft reduction in max deviation).

### ~~16. Dead field `_nextSegmentBearing` in GroundNavigator~~ — **FIXED**

Implemented pre-turning: when within ~50ft of a junction node with a known next-segment bearing, blends the steer target toward the outbound bearing. Uses new `GeoMath.BlendBearings()`. Also switched `ComputeArcSteering` to use local curvature at the lookahead point (floored at min-radius speed) instead of global min-radius, allowing faster traversal on gentle arc sections.

### ~~18. Exit BFS skips fillet arcs — takes straight shortcut~~ — **FIXED**

Split BFS seeding into two passes: arcs first, then straight edges. Arcs claim the visited set so straight shortcuts to already-visited nodes are skipped. OAK G deviation: 72ft → 28ft. OAK P: 63ft → 6ft.

**Open question:** Should `RunwayExitPhase` hand off to the taxi pathfinder instead of maintaining a separate BFS? The pathfinder already handles arc-aware routing. The BFS exit selection logic (position, speed, preference, exit angle) would remain; only the "route from branch to hold-short" portion would use the pathfinder.

### ~~19. Preserve stubs cut straight across curved taxiways~~ — **FIXED**

Three fixes:
1. Preserve stubs connect to the first neighbor (`otherNode`) when the tangent is past shape-point nodes, instead of a straight 150ft shortcut to the tangent.
2. `RescueOrphanedTangentNodes` post-fillet pass reconnects tangent nodes left orphaned when a later intersection's Phase D consumed their connecting edge.
3. `RemoveRedundantPreserveEdges` post-fillet pass removes collinear preserve stubs that are superseded by shorter shorten/tangent-link edges from other intersections in the same direction. Plus collinear stub deduplication within the same intersection.

### ~~17. Fixed bezier lookahead fraction in ComputeArcSteering~~ — **FIXED**

Replaced `t + 0.15` parameter-based lookahead with distance-based `AdvanceByDistance(bezier, t, 40ft)`. Walks along the curve accumulating arc length to find the lookahead parameter. Dramatically improved exit J (145° turn): 182ft → 85ft max deviation.
