# ERAM Functionality Audit — YAAT server emulation vs. CRC

**Date:** 2026-07-03
**Scope:** Full `docs/crc/eram.md` surface (client-display features catalogued and flagged N/A-for-server).
**System under audit:** `yaat-server` CRC ERAM emulation + shared `Yaat.Sim` track/handoff/pointout logic.

**Sources compared:**
1. **Behavior spec** — `docs/crc/eram.md` (official vNAS CRC ERAM user documentation).
2. **Decompiled CRC client** — `X:/dev/crc-decompiled/CRC/Vatsim.Nas.Crc.Ui.Displays.Eram.*` (the client YAAT feeds; authoritative for the wire contract and MCA command syntax).
3. **Rust read-only emulation** — `X:/dev/vatsim-server-rs` (`radar_state/src/eram_state.rs`, `server/src/clientstate/eram.rs`, `messaging/src/dtos.rs`). Display-only by design — it deliberately omits interactive control (handoffs, pointouts, amendments), so for those features it is "n/a" and the authorities are the spec + decompiled CRC; for display/wire features (targets, data blocks, DTO topics) it is a real reference.

**Method:** 11 parallel dimension finders classified 162 ERAM features `implemented` / `partial` / `missing` / `na_client_side` with file:line evidence; each `missing`/`partial` gap then got an independent adversarial verifier prompted to *refute* it; a completeness critic then read the full spec against the union of covered features. Reconciliation applied each verifier's verdict as the final word over the finder's original call (2 finder false-positives refuted → reclassified `implemented`; 14 reclassified in status/severity; 53 confirmed).

> **Verification note:** one gap's verifier agent died (schema retry-cap) — *Point Outs → "Inter-facility point-out target resolution"* — so it was **re-verified by hand** post-run and confirmed (`partial`/medium). 13 `low`-severity gaps were not individually verified (verification was capped at the 10 highest-severity gaps per dimension; the dropped ones are all `low`), flagged **(UNVERIFIED)** below.

---

## Executive summary

YAAT's ERAM emulation has a **solid wire/DTO backbone and a complete interactive-control engine reachable from the YAAT (instructor/RPO) training client**, but a **thin and incomplete CRC-facing MCA command surface**. The recurring pattern: the underlying capability usually *exists in `Yaat.Sim`/`TrackCommandHandler`* and is exercised by the YAAT client over the SignalR training hub, but the **`ProcessEramMessage` verb switch that a real CRC ERAM controller talks to does not route to it**. A student sitting on a CRC Center (ERAM) position therefore cannot perform several core en-route workflows from their keyboard, even though the same action works when driven by the YAAT client.

**What is genuinely solid** (baseline, don't re-verify): the ERAM topic/DTO wire contract (EramTargets, EramTracks, EramDataBlocks, EramPointout, EramSectorConfiguration, EramRouteLines, ProcessEramMessage result DTO) with correct field ordering and enum parity; track ownership + authorization guards; the full handoff/pointout/consolidation **engine** (initiate/accept/recall/force/auto-accept/redirect) on the YAAT-client path; auto-track (`.autotrack`/UpdateAutoTrackAirports) including departure acquisition and delta semantics; NEXRAD; QL quick-look storage; FDB field population.

**Headline defects** (7 distinct high-severity issues; the 13 raw high-gaps collapse because 4 dimensions independently found the handoff gap, 2 found the QX gap, and 3 found the QZ/QQ inversion):

| # | Defect | Effect |
|---|--------|--------|
| H1 | **ERAM handoffs (initiate/accept/recall/force) not dispatched over the CRC wire** | A CRC ERAM controller cannot hand off, accept, recall, or force a track from the keyboard. Logic exists but only the YAAT client can reach it. STARS implements this fully — pure asymmetry. |
| H2 | **No implied-command fallback in the `ProcessEramMessage` verb switch** | Bare `<FLID>`, numeric leader `1 <FLID>`, `/len`, sector-id handoff, `/OK` — a large fraction of routine ERAM interaction — all hit `default → FORMAT`. Root cause of H1, H3, and several mediums. |
| H3 | **`QX` (drop track) verb unhandled** | F4 / typing `QX <FLID>` returns FORMAT. Drop works only via the non-spec `QT D` form, which also leaves `HandoffPeer`/`HandoffInitiatedAt`/`CreatedByOwner` stale. |
| H4 | **`QZ`/`QQ` altitude semantics inverted vs spec** | `QZ` (should set *assigned* altitude) writes *interim*; `QQ` (should set *interim*) writes *assigned*. Controllers set the wrong altitude field. |
| H5 | **Data-block `Format` hard-coded to `Fdb` for every track, globally** | LDBs never appear; every sector sees every track as a full FDB; QL quick-look is inert; the inbound-handoff "LDB→FDB" cue is absent. Not computed per subscribing sector. |
| H6 | **EramDataBlocks create/delete ID mismatch → ghost data blocks** | Create keys blocks on bare callsign; every delete path keys on `"CALLSIGN"+callsign`, so `Remove` never matches and FDBs persist after the aircraft is gone. |
| H7 | **ERAM conflict alert / STCA entirely unpublished** | An ERAM controller receives *no* conflict alerts (no STC list, no flashing data block). The `EramShortTermConflicts` topic is a stub returning `null`; `ConflictStatus` is hard-coded `NoConflict`. |

Beyond these, the display fidelity of **targets** (7 of 8 symbol types unreachable — all traffic is `CorrelatedBeacon`), **track status** (coast/frozen/free never render), **target history trails**, and **CRR groups** are missing or stubbed, and several flight-plan MCA commands (`AM`, `DM`, `VP`, `QB`, `QR`, `QU`-amend) are absent or mis-wired.

---

## Systemic root causes

Most gaps trace to nine systemic causes. Fixing the cause resolves the cluster.

### A. `ProcessEramMessage` has no implied-command / fallback arm
`yaat-server: src/Yaat.Server/Hubs/CrcClientState.Eram.cs:47-61` switches on `elements[0].Token` and handles only `QN/QF/QL/RD/QU/QT/QZ/QQ/QS/QP/QR`, falling through to `_ => (false, ["FORMAT"], null)`. CRC's `InputManager` handles only `SR/QD/WR/MR/QB/AR` client-side and sends *everything else* — including all implied commands and handoffs — to this one method (`crc-decompiled: …/Eram.Input/InputManager.cs:505-529`). So any first token that is a bare FLID, a digit `1-9` (leader direction), `//`/`/len`, a sector id, `/OK`, or a verb not in the list is rejected.
**Cluster:** H1, H2, H3, plus MISSING `DM`, `VP`, `AM`, `LA`/`LB`/`LC`, `QB`(assign), `LF`, `RF`, `QH`; PARTIAL leader-direction numeric parse, datablock FLID-cycle, `/OK <FLID>` force.

### B. Data-block `Format` is a global constant, never computed per sector
`DtoConverter.ToEramDataBlock` (`yaat-server: src/Yaat.Server/Simulation/DtoConverter.cs:560`) hard-codes `Format = EramDataBlockFormat.Fdb` and takes no subscribing-sector argument; `CrcBroadcastService.cs:165-168,1290` broadcasts one shared block list to all ERAM subscribers. Contrast EramTracks, which *is* recomputed per subscriber (`CrcBroadcastService.cs:1567`). The Rust reference computes it per sector (`vatsim-server-rs: crates/server/src/clientstate/eram.rs:384-446`: FDB if handoff-to-me / quicklooked / owned, else paired/unpaired LDB).
**Cluster:** H5, PARTIAL Quick-Look (inert), PARTIAL inbound-handoff FDB flash, MISSING datablock FLID-cycle/minimize, MISSING RDB/CDB.

### C. Target `SymbolType` is hard-coded `CorrelatedBeacon`
`DtoConverter.cs:265` emits `CorrelatedBeacon` for every aircraft; `WasModeCPreviouslyReceived=true`, `BlinkSpc=false`, `IsCorrelated=true` are likewise constants. The discriminating sim data exists (`AircraftTransponder.Mode/Code/IsIdenting`). 7 of the 8 spec symbol types (eram.md Table 1) are unreachable.
**Cluster:** MISSING Ident / Primary(standby) / MCI / VFR(1200) / Reduced-separation symbols; PARTIAL correlation-symbol engine; PARTIAL WasModeCPreviouslyReceived/BlinkSpc.

### D. ERAM track `Status` hard-coded `Normal`, `IsCorrelated` hard-coded `true`
`DtoConverter.cs:577-578` — the only assignment to `EramTrackDto.Status` anywhere. `Coasting`/`Frozen` enum members (`CrcDtos.Session.cs:299-300`) are dead code; `AircraftEramState` has no status/coast/frozen field. CRC renders the four track types and CST/FRZN Field-E from this wire field.
**Cluster:** PARTIAL four-track-types; MISSING coast-on-target-loss; MISSING QH freeze; PARTIAL Field-E CST/FRZN.

### E. ERAM conflict alert / STCA is unpublished
`CrcBroadcastService.cs:117-121` stubs `EramShortTermConflicts` returning `null` with a misleading "Populated in later buckets" comment; no `EramShortTermConflictDto` / `ReceiveEramShortTermConflicts` exists; `ConflictStatus` hard-coded `NoConflict`. YAAT already computes STARS conflicts (`ConflictAlertDetector`), but it is STARS-shaped (5 s prediction, flat 3nm/1000ft, terminal-corridor suppression, no facility-ownership gate) and not ERAM-tuned (4-min lookahead, 5nm / 3nm≤FL230, data-block altitude).
**Cluster:** H7, MISSING EramShortTermConflicts topic, PARTIAL detector-fidelity, MISSING CDB.

### F. Missing server-provided display topics
Three topics the CRC client subscribes to are never published: **EramTargetHistories** (history trail; grep = none), **EramShortTermConflicts** (stub → null), **EramCrrGroups** (stub → null; `SetEramCrrGroupColor`/`ClearOrDeleteEramCrrGroup` are NilAck no-ops). These are server-supplied *data*, not client-only concerns.

### G. Altitude command wiring is inverted / mis-routed
`QZ`↔`QQ` swapped (H4). Additionally `QR` (controller-entered reported altitude / CERA) is mis-bound to `DispatchRd` (route display) with a "redirect semantics deferred" comment (`CrcClientState.Eram.cs:59`) — it is not merely absent but wired to the wrong behavior.

### H. EramDataBlocks delete-ID format mismatch (H6)
Create sets `Id = ac.Callsign` (bare, `DtoConverter.cs:558`); every delete path sends `"CALLSIGN"+callsign` (`CrcBroadcastService.cs:599,739,942,1303-1306`). CRC's `DataBlockRepository` removes by exact id string, so the delete never matches → ghost FDBs. (The bare id also diverges from the canonical vsrs id format.)

### I. FLID resolution is callsign-only
`RoomEngine.FindAircraft` (`yaat-server: src/Yaat.Server/Simulation/RoomEngine.cs:947`) matches `a.Callsign` only, but the spec defines an FLID as **ACID *or* assigned beacon code *or* CID** (eram.md:1589). YAAT generates 3-char CIDs and broadcasts both CID and beacon on the wire, yet typing either into the MCA returns "FLID not found". Cross-cutting: affects every `<FLID>` command. *(Surfaced by the completeness critic, not the per-dimension finders.)*

| Inter-facility point-out target resolution | 🟡 | 🟠 **(verified✓)** | Same-facility `QP 15 <cs>` OK; cross-ARTCC `ZLA15` (no delimiter) → `FAC_SEC` underscore split can't parse it → defaults to caller's own facility. Underscore convention is YAAT-invented; real client never sends it | `CrcClientState.Eram.cs:605-614` |
| Point-out state re-broadcast (change-tracking) | 🟡 | 🟢 | Pointout change re-sends EramTrack → `Eram.Pointouts` not in any fingerprint; relies on position churn | `AircraftChangeTracker.cs:507-515` |

### 4. ERAM↔STARS Handoff, QT & Consolidation

> Note: the data-backed views (Beacon Code, Altimeter, Weather Station) are catalogued N/A-client for *rendering*, but each depends on a server command/data feed (`QB`, `AR`/`QD`, `WR`) that is **absent** — so they are functionally unusable end-to-end. Tracked under their command dimensions.

### 11. VATSIMisms & Autotrack
✅ `.autotrack`/UpdateAutoTrackAirports, delta semantics (add/`-X`/none/steal), departure acquisition, list-echo, scenario-preseeded + generator autotrack, Top-Down ground-target data publication + DB fields, TDM GeoMap flag. ⬜ Top-Down toggle/render (Ctrl+T), single-click track, declutter, scope markers (all client gestures).

| Feature | St | Sev | Expected → Actual | Theme / cite |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| FAA/ICAO departure-ID equivalence for autotrack | 🟡 | 🟠 | match FAA *or* ICAO id → only `dep == id \|\| "K"+id` (CONUS K-prefix only) | `RoomEngine.cs:1854`, `TickProcessor.cs:937,1378` |
| Ground-target heavy icon (IsHeavy) | 🟡 | 🟢 | ERAM: B757 *not* heavy → IsCwtHeavy incl. CWT 'E' marks B757 heavy | `DtoConverter.cs:1600-1604` vs `WakeTurbulenceData.cs:46-48` |

## Completeness-critic findings (missed by the per-dimension finders)

| # | Item | Sev | Why it matters | Cite |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| C1 | **FLID resolution by CID and assigned beacon code** (not just callsign) | 🟠 | Spec: FLID = ACID *or* beacon *or* CID (eram.md:1589). YAAT generates CIDs and broadcasts CID+beacon, but `FindAircraft` matches callsign only → typing a visible CID/beacon returns "FLID not found" on *every* `<FLID>` command | `RoomEngine.cs:947` |
| C2 | FDB Field-E SPC text values (HIJK/RDOF/EMRG/ADIZ/LLNK/AFIO) | 🟢 | Client-rendered from beacon code; STARS path has `GetForcedSpcs`, but ERAM ADIZ(1276)/AFIO(7777) never enumerated | eram.md:652-657 |
| C3 | Multiple-FLID batch entry (`QQ 110 A/B/C`, `QU`, `LF`) | 🟢 | Dispatcher pulls a single `firstCallsign`; slash-separated lists affect ≤1 aircraft silently | `CrcClientState.Eram.cs:22,31,44` |
| C4 | `QQ` override tokens `/TT` and `///` (not `/OK`) | 🟢 | QQ uniquely overrides logic checks with `/TT`/`///`; DispatchQq recognizes neither | eram.md:1017 |
| C5 | External-ARTCC edit lock persists even with `/OK` | 🟢 | Distinct auth rule: `/OK` overrides same-facility checks but must **not** allow editing a flight owned by a different ARTCC | eram.md:48 |

Critic's overall read: coverage of the spec's Contents list is thorough; the display/wire contract is the strong part; **gaps concentrate in MCA input-parsing fidelity**, not the wire.

## Prioritized remediation checklist

**Tier 1 — core CRC-ERAM workflows broken (do first):**
- [x] **Add an implied-command dispatch arm to `ProcessEramMessage`** (root cause A) — route bare `<FLID>`, numeric leader `1-9`, `/len`, `<sector> <FLID>`, and `/OK <FLID>` instead of `default → FORMAT`. Unblocks handoffs, drop, datablock toggle/positioning. *(#243, `DispatchImplied` + per-sector `EramRoomState.FdbOpen`.)*
- [x] **Wire ERAM handoffs over the CRC path** (H1) — initiate/accept/recall/force → existing `TrackCommandHandler.HandleHandoff`/`HandleAccept`/`HandleForceHandoff`. Mirror the STARS implementation (`CrcClientState.Stars.cs:364-427`). *(#244; also fixed force-take leaving stale `HandoffPeer`.)*
- [x] **Handle the `QX` drop verb** (H3) → `TrackEngine.HandleDrop` (which correctly clears HandoffPeer/HandoffInitiatedAt/CreatedByOwner); retire or alias the non-spec `QT D`. *(#245, `DispatchQx`; removed `QT D`.)*
- [x] **Fix the `QZ`↔`QQ` inversion** (H4) — QZ writes assigned, QQ writes interim; add QQ R/L/P sub-modes + clear forms. *(#246: QZ amends the flight plan via AmendFlightPlan incl. VFR/OTP; QQ interim/R/L/P/clear with interim⊥procedure; deleted redundant `Stars.AssignedAltitude`. QZ block-altitude split to a follow-up.)*
- [x] **Fix the EramDataBlocks delete-ID mismatch** (H6) — align create/delete id (adopt the canonical vsrs id format). *(#247: create id now `CALLSIGN{callsign}`.)*
- [ ] **Compute data-block `Format` per subscribing sector** (H5) — FDB if owned/handoff-to-me/quicklooked/manually-open, else paired/unpaired LDB (mirror `vsrs eram.rs:384-446`). Also makes QL and the inbound-handoff cue work.
- [ ] **Publish ERAM conflict alerts** (H7) — implement `EramShortTermConflicts` topic + DTO from the existing `ConflictAlertState`; set `ConflictStatus`. (Detector-fidelity retune is a follow-on.)

**Tier 2 — display fidelity & notable commands:**
- [ ] Target `SymbolType` engine (root cause C): ident, primary(standby), VFR(1200), MCI/uncorrelated-beacon, reduced-sep from existing transponder data.
- [ ] ERAM track `Status` (root cause D): coast-on-target-loss (CST), and a frozen field for `QH`.
- [ ] Publish `EramTargetHistories` (root cause F) from `AircraftState.PositionHistory`.
- [ ] Field-E accepted indicator `Oxxx`/`Kxxx`/`OUNK` (populate RecentHandoffPeer/WasForced).
- [ ] `QR` → controller-entered reported altitude (currently mis-wired to route display).
- [ ] `QU` route amendment (direct-to + FRD) and filed-route polyline for `QU` display.
- [ ] `AM`, `DM`, `VP`, `QB`(assign) MCA commands.
- [ ] `QS` HSF fourth-line fields (heading/speed/free-text) instead of STARS Scratchpad1.
- [ ] `QP` point-out: fix inverted `ClearEramPointout` caller-auth; typed `QP A <sector> <FLID>`; `QP <FLID>` minimize.
- [ ] **C1: FLID resolution by CID / beacon code** in `FindAircraft`.
- [ ] EramTargetDto.GroundSpeed population; leader-direction numeric parse.

**Tier 3 — niche / low incidence:**
- [ ] CRR groups (`EramCrrGroups` topic + `LF`), RDB/CDB, DRI halos (`QP J/T`), Non-RVSM/SatComm derivation, `LA`/`LB`/`LC` readouts, `RF` FP transfer, block/above altitudes, ParsedAltitude, ground-target B757 heavy exception, autotrack FAA/ICAO equivalence.
- [ ] C2–C5 parsing nuances (SPC Field-E values, multi-FLID batch, `/TT`/`///` override, external-ARTCC edit lock).

## Caveats & verification notes

- **Reconciliation:** 80 gaps after applying verifier verdicts (53 confirmed, 14 reclassified in status/severity, 2 finder false-positives refuted and dropped). Severities are the verifier-corrected values.
- **Unverified (13, all `low`):** the one gap whose verifier agent died — *Point Outs → "Inter-facility point-out target resolution"* — was re-verified by hand and **confirmed** (see dim 3). The remaining 13 unverified gaps are all `low`-severity, not individually adversarially checked because verification was capped at the 10 highest-severity gaps per dimension; they carry the finder's classification (flagged **(UNVERIFIED)** in the tables). Re-verify before acting on any of them.
- **Duplication is intentional in the tables** (per-dimension traceability): H1 appears under dims 2, 4, 7; H3 under 1, 7; H4 under 7, 8. The root-cause section deduplicates.
- **YAAT vs vsrs framing:** for interactive-control features (handoffs, pointouts, amendments) vsrs is correctly "n/a" (read-only by design); the authorities there are the spec + decompiled CRC. For display/wire features vsrs was used as the concrete reference (and YAAT matches it on the core EramTarget/EramTrack contract).
- **Not a defect:** the FDB column-0 "R" not-your-control indicator is client-rendered from the wire `Owner` field (Key 3), which YAAT emits correctly.

*Audit artifacts (session-local): reconciled digest and per-gap evidence in the workflow transcript `journal.jsonl`; run `wf_140b5ca2-bd6`.*
