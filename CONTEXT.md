# YAAT

Instructor/RPO client and training server for VATSIM air traffic control training. `Yaat.Sim` owns
the simulation; every other project is a way of driving or displaying it.

This glossary fixes the words that have caused real confusion. It is a glossary, not a spec — no
implementation detail, no decisions. Decisions live in [`docs/adr/`](docs/adr/).

## Simulation execution

**Sim-second**:
One second of simulated time, structured as PrePhysics, four physics sub-ticks, PostPhysics, and the
end-of-second steps. The unit every run advances by.
_Avoid_: tick (ambiguous between the sim-second and one physics sub-tick — say which)

**Spine**:
The single ordered definition of the simulation-affecting steps in a sim-second. There is exactly
one, it lives in `Yaat.Sim`, and every run iterates it rather than keeping its own list.
_Avoid_: pipeline, tick list, post-physics list

**Step**:
One member of the spine.
_Avoid_: stage, phase (phase means an aircraft's flight phase in this codebase and nothing else)

**Segment**:
One of the five parts of a sim-second the spine is entered by: begin, open, pre-physics, physics, post-physics,
end-of-second. A run that cannot advance a whole second at once (the sub-tick replay step) composes segments.
_Avoid_: phase, stage

**Host**:
The collaborator a run supplies to the spine: it provides each step's arguments and consumes each
step's results. One meaning only, reclaimed from six unrelated prior uses.
_Avoid_: sink, adapter, driver

**Run profile**:
What kind of run this is and, consequently, what is allowed to differ from any other run. Separate
from the host on purpose, so a step can ask its host for an argument without being able to ask it
whether this is a replay.
_Avoid_: mode, context, environment

**Run kind**:
A value of the run profile: live, replay, test, or soak.

**State-equivalence**:
The contract between runs: given the same inputs, every run kind produces the same world state.

**Oracle**:
The mechanical test of state-equivalence — it runs one scenario under several run kinds and compares
the resulting state, rather than relying on anyone having classified the steps correctly.

**Recorded input**:
A value the simulation consumes but does not derive, captured so a replay reproduces it rather than
recomputing it. Attendance is the first of these.

**Attendance**:
Which controller positions are currently being worked. Live, it derives from connections; everywhere
else it is a recorded input.
_Avoid_: staffing (staffing means which positions the controller AI has been configured to work)

**Wire projection**:
The server-side mapping between a simulation concept and the CRC wire records that carry it. The
projection is the server's; the concept is the simulation's.

**Coast**:
The interval during which a track that has gone away is still displayed before its delete is emitted.
Measured in sim-seconds.

## Controller actions

**Action**:
One thing a controller did to the simulation — a typed command, a CRC keyboard entry, an AI position's
instruction — as one text, one issuer and one verdict. The unit the action log holds.
_Avoid_: command (a command is the text; an action is the text plus who issued it and what it did), event

**Action router**:
The single route every action takes, on every run kind, from text to effect. There is exactly one,
it lives in `Yaat.Sim`, and no entry point decides anything the router decides.
_Avoid_: dispatch chain, handler chain, command pipeline (the pipeline is the whole path from keyboard to aircraft)

**Kind**:
What sort of action a text is, decided once by the router before anything runs. Every text has exactly
one kind; a text with none is an error, never a default.
_Avoid_: category, verb type

**Arm**:
The router's body for one kind: either simulation logic, or a slot the host fills because the state
is still the host's.
_Avoid_: handler, branch, case

**Scope**:
What the router resolves before an arm runs — nothing, a callsign, a present aircraft, or the acting
position. A property of the kind, not of the recorded text.
_Avoid_: target, addressee

**Baked draw**:
A value a live action drew — a reaction delay, a spawned aircraft, a strip id — carried on its record
so every later run reuses it instead of drawing again.
_Avoid_: cached value, seed

**Derived record**:
A record of a state change no verb names, written by whatever made the change so that a later run
reproduces it.
_Avoid_: synthetic action, side-effect record

**Replay fidelity**:
The property that a recorded action reaches the same verdict when re-applied as it did live. A
difference is reported, never hidden by dropping the record.
_Avoid_: determinism (determinism is the same-seed, same-world property of the simulation itself)
