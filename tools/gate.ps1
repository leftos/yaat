.SYNOPSIS
The gate a repo runs: it hands every word to the user-level gate when the machine has one, and otherwise runs the
command under a smaller wrapper that keeps the log, the tail and the exit status.

.DESCRIPTION
tools/sync-launchers.ps1 publishes this file into a repo as tools/gate.ps1, and a repo carries this launcher rather than a copy of
the gate: a change to the canonical gate, at `$env:CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR\tools\gate\gate.ps1`, or the user's
`~/.claude\tools\gate\gate.ps1` when that variable is unset, reaches every repo at once, and a caller keeps invoking
tools/gate.ps1 as it always did, `pwsh -NoProfile -File tools/gate.ps1 ...` or `& tools/gate.ps1 ...`.

When the canonical gate is there, every word is handed to it in this same process, so the call is the gate's own:
-StopTree and the exit status included.

When it is not, as on another developer's clone, the fallback runs the command itself. It keeps the whole output in the
log, the last -Tail lines on the screen, the command's own exit status, the failure markers that make a zero exit whose
output reports a failure a failure, below-normal priority for the command, and -StopTree, which stops the processes one
Win32_Process snapshot shows under the pid, a process whose parent has already exited being beyond it, since only a job
holds that one. It drops the parts that need the gate's machine: the slot pools, the watchdog's stall kill and ceiling,
its wall-time backstop, and the handling of build servers. It says so on standard error before the command starts, one
line, `gate: <path> not found; running without slots or watchdog`, so a run with no watchdog is never read as one with.

Like the gate, and for the same reason, the options are read by hand out of $args rather than declared in a param
block: a declared block sends the bare -- of a caller's command through PowerShell's parameter binder, which reads it
as a parameter name and stops. The command is every word after a --, or, when the caller's session ate the separator,
every word from the first that is not one of the options. A caller that starts this launcher with -File gives the
binder a -name:value word to split in $args, where the process argv keeps it whole, so the words are read from the argv
in that case, and a -name:value word the binder left as -name: and value is joined back into one word, the gate this
launcher forwards to and the fallback's command both getting it whole.
