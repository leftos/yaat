.SYNOPSIS
Runs one gate command with four things always given, the log, the ceiling, the slot kind and the command: the whole
output to the log, the last lines on the screen, the command's own exit status, and 124 when the watchdog killed it.

.DESCRIPTION
The canonical copy is ~/.claude/tools/gate/gate.ps1: change it there and run sync-gate.ps1, which copies it and
gate.selftest.ps1 into every repo that carries them.

Usage: pwsh tools/gate.ps1 -Log <path> -TimeoutSeconds <n> -Slot heavy|light [-StallSeconds <n>] [-Tail <n>] [-NoMarkers] -- <command> [args...]
       pwsh tools/gate.ps1 -StopTree <pid>

The log, the ceiling, the slot kind and the command are all required and none has a default: a gate run without a
ceiling is the one that holds its caller for an hour, and a caller that forgot one is told so, with the usage, and the
script exits 2 before anything runs. Each missing or unreadable input is named on a line of its own. The gate runs on Windows only.

Why this exists:
 - Every line a command prints lands in an agent's context and is re-read on every later turn, so a build or a test run
   prints its last lines on the screen and the rest stays in the log. Read or `rg` the log for the rest; never re-run
   the command to see its output again.
 - A pipeline reports the last command's status, so `cmd 2>&1 | Tee-Object log | Select-Object -Last 20` passes even
   when the build failed. This wrapper exits with the command's own status, and additionally fails when the log holds a
   known failure marker: a runner can print a green summary for stale binaries after "Build FAILED" and still exit 0.
 - A gate that hangs holds its caller until something else gives up, ten minutes and more. Every gate runs under a
   watchdog, and a run it kills is killed with every process it started and reported as 124, the status coreutils
   `timeout` uses, so no caller reads it as the command's own.

The command runs in a Windows job object of its own, and every process it starts, and every process those start, is
created in that job. The job is the command's tree: the watchdog measures it and a kill terminates it whole, so a
process whose parent has already exited is still watched and still killed. The gate creates the command suspended,
assigns it to the job and only then lets it run, so nothing the command starts can run outside the job. It creates the
command with the desktop app policy that keeps every process the command and its descendants create inside the
desktop app runtime: without it, every child of a packaged app, such as the pwsh the Microsoft Store installs, is
created outside the job however the job is set (measured 2026-09-27), and neither watched nor killed. The job does
not kill its processes when the gate ends: the compiler server a build starts is created inside the job (measured 2026-09-27: VBCSCompiler
was in the job and died with it when the job was set to kill on close), and a normal exit leaves it running to serve
the builds after this one. A process the command leaves running is therefore killed only when the watchdog kills the
run. The job lets a process that asks to break away do so, since without that its start fails; one that breaks away is
outside the tree. A gate inside a gate nests one job inside the other, so the outer gate's kill reaches the inner
gate's command too.

The job is named Local\gate-job-<the gate's own pid>, so a caller that must stop a gate from outside finds its job from
the gate's pid: `pwsh tools/gate.ps1 -StopTree <pid>` takes one snapshot of the processes under <pid>, <pid> included,
terminates the job of every gate among them, then terminates every process of the snapshot still running, deepest
first. A job holds what a parent chain loses: a process whose parent has already exited is missed by anything that
follows parent pids, such as `taskkill /T`, and only the gate's job still holds it. The name lives only while the gate
holds the job, so a gate already gone leaves nothing to find by it.

The watchdog samples the job every few seconds and kills it for the first of three reasons, each with its own line in
the log and on standard error:
 - `gate: STALLED`: nothing happened for -StallSeconds. Nothing is the log and <log>.err not growing, the job gaining
   no CPU time (its accounting, which counts the jobs nested in it and the processes that have exited), no new process
   appearing in it, and no build server (below) started since the command was gaining CPU time. A stalled run has
   hung: read the log for where it stopped.
 - `gate: TIMED OUT`: the ceiling ran out on the load-adjusted clock. That clock advances by the share of the machine
   the command could have had: each sample adds its wall time times the share of logical processors not busy with
   other work (never less than 5%), so on an idle machine it is wall time and on a machine that other sessions keep
   busy it runs slower. A run that times out kept working past its ceiling even allowing for load: a busy loop, or a
   ceiling set too tight. Read the log before raising it.
 - `gate: BACKSTOP`: five times the ceiling passed in plain wall time, whatever the load. The line gives the share of
   the machine that was free on average; a low one means the machine was busy rather than the command wrong, so run it
   once more alone before reading anything into it.
A kill adds `gate: terminated the job's <n> processes` to the log, n being the processes the job held at the kill. A
command that exits on its own between the sample that found a reason and the kill keeps its own status. The passed
line gives the wall time, the load-adjusted time and the ceiling side by side, so a ceiling that is getting tight
shows before it bites. When a sample throws, the gate says
`gate: sampler failed: <message>; watching by wall time only` once and takes no more samples: the stall and the
ceiling can no longer be told, and only the backstop, which needs nothing but a clock, still kills the run. A failure
anywhere else after the command has started terminates the job, adds the error to the log and ends the gate with it.

At most a few gates run at once across the machine, one to a slot, and a slot is heavy or light, as -Slot says. The
heavy slots are the named mutexes Local\gate-slot-0 to Local\gate-slot-<n-1>, n being $env:GATE_HEAVY_SLOTS or, unset,
a quarter of the logical processors after one is left for the user (at least one): a heavy gate is taken to keep about
four threads busy through its own parallelism. The light slots are Local\gate-light-slot-0 to
Local\gate-light-slot-<m-1>, m being $env:GATE_LIGHT_SLOTS or, unset, half the logical processors after one is left for
the user (at least one): a light gate is taken to keep one or two threads busy. The two pools are independent: a gate
takes one slot of its own kind and never waits on the other kind, so a serial test run does not queue behind builds,
nor builds behind it. The heavy slots bear the names a copy of the gate without -Slot takes, so such a copy shares the
heavy pool. A gate that finds every slot of its kind held says `gate: waiting for a heavy slot` (or a light one) once
and tries again every 2 s, and its clocks start once it holds one. Mutexes rather than a counting semaphore because a
killed gate abandons its mutex, which the next gate then takes, saying so, where a semaphore's count would be lost for
good. The command is started with GATE_SLOT_HELD=1, so a gate it runs in turn (a gate inside a gate) takes no slot of
either kind and does not wait on the one its parent holds, though it still needs -Slot; set that variable yourself to
run a gate outside the slots. GATE_SAMPLE_SECONDS sets the sampling interval, 5 s when unset.
GATE_TEST_SAMPLER_FAIL=1 is for the self-test only: it makes every sample throw, to prove the path above.
GATE_TEST_SLOT_PREFIX is for the self-test only: up to 32 letters, digits and dashes put in front of both pools' mutex
names (Local\<prefix>gate-slot-<i>, Local\<prefix>gate-light-slot-<i>), so its slot cases use slots no other session
holds. GATE_TEST_NATIVE_CACHE is for the self-test only: the folder used in place of the native cache below.

The gate's native calls are C# compiled with Add-Type into a class named after a hash of their source. The compiled
assembly is cached per user as $env:LOCALAPPDATA\gate\GateNative_<hash>.dll and loaded from there, since compiling it
costs every gate about a second of CPU. The first gate of a version compiles it to a file of its own in that folder and
moves it into place; a gate that loses that race to another deletes its own copy, so no gate loads a half-written file.
A gate that cannot write the folder or load the file compiles the class in memory as before, says
`gate: native cache unusable (<reason>); compiled in memory` once, and runs on. A new version of the source has a new
hash and so a new file; the old files stay until deleted by hand.

The command runs at below-normal priority, so the machine stays usable while it does: the gate creates it in that
class, or in the gate's own when the gate already runs at below-normal or idle, and everything it starts inherits the
class. A build server already running from an earlier build (VBCSCompiler, or an MSBuild node that dotnet leaves
running) is not started by the command and does not inherit it, so the watchdog lowers any it finds above below-normal,
once each; one it cannot lower is named once in the log and does not fail the gate. A build server outside the job
started after the command was counts as progress, because a build hands its compiling to it; one that was already
running does not, because the servers other sessions' builds left behind gain CPU all the time and would keep a hung
command from ever reading as stalled. A build that hands its work to an old server still shows progress through its
own output. Callers never wrap a gate in `nice` or set a priority of their own.

A gate's builds start MSBuild worker nodes of their own: the command runs with MSBUILDDISABLENODEREUSE=1 and
DOTNET_CLI_USE_MSBUILD_SERVER=0, so its nodes run inside the command's job, where their CPU is measured, they inherit
below-normal priority and they die with a kill, instead of being handed to nodes some earlier build left running. That
costs a build a few seconds of node start-up (0.4 s to 3 s, measured 2026-09-27 on two .NET repos). The compiler
server, VBCSCompiler, stays shared, because a build without it ran three to five times slower; it is covered by the
rules above. Like the priority, both variables are set only for the command: the gate takes the caller's values back
once it has started.

The command's standard output goes to -Log and its standard error to <log>.err, and its standard input is NUL; it
inherits those three handles and no other of the gate's, and it shares the gate's console, so Ctrl+C reaches it. Once
the process has ended the .err file is appended to the log and removed, so one file holds everything, the output first
and the errors after it, then the gate's own lines. The command runs in the caller's working directory, its PowerShell
location when it runs the gate in its own session, and a relative -Log is read from it too. A .cmd or .bat command runs
through cmd.exe /d /s /c.

The options are read by hand out of $args rather than declared in a param block: a declared block sends this script's
own arguments through PowerShell's parameter binder, which reads the bare -- of
`pwsh tools/gate.ps1 -Log x -TimeoutSeconds 5 -Slot heavy -- dotnet test -c Release` as a parameter name and stops with "the
parameter name '' is ambiguous" (PowerShell 7.5, 2026-09-14). A script with no param block is handed every word
untouched, separator and all, which is what lets the command keep its own -c. A caller in a session of its own
(`& tools/gate.ps1 ... -- dotnet build`) has the separator eaten by the parser before the script ever sees it, so the
command is read as everything past a --, or as the first word that is not one of the options above. It is then started
as it arrived, never through Invoke-Expression, so nothing in it is re-parsed by a shell.

.PARAMETER Log
Required. Where the whole output is written, its directory created when missing, and an earlier run's log replaced.
<log>.err holds the command's standard error until the process ends and it is appended here.

.PARAMETER TimeoutSeconds
Required, a whole number above 0. The ceiling on the load-adjusted clock, and a fifth of the wall-time backstop. A
ceiling is a few times what the command takes on an idle machine today.

.PARAMETER Slot
Required, heavy or light: the pool of slots the gate waits on (see above). heavy for a command that keeps many threads
busy, such as a build or a parallel test run; light for one that keeps one or two busy, such as a serial test run or
one headless engine run. When unsure, heavy: a light gate whose command keeps many threads busy takes cores the heavy
slots count on, where a heavy gate whose command keeps one busy only waits longer than it had to.

.PARAMETER StallSeconds
How long the command may go without output, CPU time or a new process before it is killed as stalled. Defaults to 120.

.PARAMETER Tail
How many of the log's last lines are printed. Defaults to 20.

.PARAMETER NoMarkers
A switch: the log is not scanned for failure markers, so the command's own exit status is the verdict. For a command
whose output can quote a failure that is not its own, such as a tool whose output quotes another program's error lines.

.PARAMETER StopTree
Used alone, as the only option: the pid of a process whose tree is stopped, gates' jobs first (see above). A pid that is
not a live process is a usage error.

.OUTPUTS
With -StopTree: `gate: stopped <n> gate job(s) and <m> process(es) under <pid>` on standard output, m counting the
processes still running once the jobs were terminated, and exit 0; a job or process that could not be stopped is named on
standard error with `gate: could not stop: ` and the exit status is 1.

Otherwise: on a failure, the log's failure marker lines with their line numbers (none with -NoMarkers); then the log's last -Tail
lines, then one verdict line: `gate: passed in <w> s (load-adjusted <a> s, ceiling <n> s). Full output: <log>` on
standard output, or `gate: FAILED (status <n>). Full output: <log>` on standard error. The exit status is the command's
own, 1 for a zero exit whose log reports a failure (never with -NoMarkers), 124 for any watchdog kill, and 2 for a usage
this script could not read or a machine that is not Windows.
