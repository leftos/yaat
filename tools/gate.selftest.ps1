.SYNOPSIS
Runs tools/gate.ps1 through the cases its watchdog, job, slots, priority and usage have to get right, and exits 1 when
any case fails.

.DESCRIPTION
The canonical copy is ~/.claude/tools/gate/gate.selftest.ps1: change it there and run sync-gate.ps1, which copies it
and gate.ps1 into every repo that carries them.

Each case starts the gate as a caller would, `pwsh -NoProfile -File tools/gate.ps1 ... -Slot light ...`, every command
here being serial, with a log under .tmp/gate-selftest, and prints `ok <case>` or `FAIL <case>: <why>`. The gate samples
every second here (GATE_SAMPLE_SECONDS=1) so the stall and ceiling cases end in seconds. Every case but the slot cases
and the nesting case runs with GATE_SLOT_HELD=1, so the self-test never waits on, or holds up, the gates other sessions
are running; the slot cases and the nesting case set GATE_TEST_SLOT_PREFIX to a prefix of this run's own, so their
gates take slots no other session's gate can hold. The cases that leave a process behind on purpose write its pid to a
file, check it by pid and stop it by pid afterwards. Each gate started as its own process gets 90 s of wall time,
after which the case fails and the gate is killed with its tree. A case whose verdict rests on timing and fails while
its log says the machine was under 30% free prints `skip <case>: machine busy (free <p>%)` instead of failing: a kill
line gives the free share outright, a passed line as the load-adjusted time over the wall time.

The cases run side by side, each set in a pwsh of its own, so a case that changes its session's environment, location
or priority changes only its own. Most spend their time waiting rather than computing, and each of those runs in a
process of its own, at most half as many at once as there are logical processors, scaled down by the share of the
machine free when the self-test starts (measured over a second) and never fewer than two. The self-test runs below normal
priority while they do, so the processes it starts, which inherit that, do not starve the commands, which run below
normal too, while they start. The cases whose command keeps a core busy
and whose verdict rests on that CPU time (CPU, a grandchild's, a packaged child's, a nested job's, short-lived children's
and the ceiling) run one after another in a single process once those are done, so that none of them shares the machine
with another. The slot cases and the nesting case run one after another in a process of their own from the start, since
they take the machine's slots and wait rather than compute, and the failing-sampler case runs last in that process: its
gates cannot say how busy the machine was, so its timing gets no skip, and by then the waiting cases have ended. Each
process's lines are printed once it and every one before it in that order has finished, so the output reads the same
from run to run.

The backstop is reached only through GATE_TEST_SAMPLER_FAIL, the gate's one test hook: tripping it with a working
sampler takes a machine busy enough that five times the ceiling passes in wall time before the ceiling does on the
load-adjusted clock, which this script cannot arrange. The race between a command's own exit and a kill is not covered:
no case can make the command exit inside the few milliseconds between the sample and the kill every time.

A plain script rather than Pester: the Pester on this machine is the in-box 3.4.

.PARAMETER Case
Runs only the cases named, one after another in this process: Test-* functions of this script's list of cases, as an
array or as one comma-separated word. Without it every case runs, side by side as above.
